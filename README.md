# Psychology Data Analysis in R 🧠📊

**Bridging psychological science and data analysis through open, reproducible research**

Welcome!  
This repository gathers a collection of psychology research projects developed in **R**, focusing on the integration of **quantitative methods**, **psychometric validation**, and **transparent research workflows**.  
Each project reflects a commitment to methodological rigor, reproducibility, and meaningful contribution to the understanding of human behavior and mental health.

## 🎯 Purpose

The repository was created to combine **psychological theory** with **advanced data-analytic practice**, promoting a culture of **clarity, openness, and collaboration** in psychological research.

It also serves as a personal academic portfolio demonstrating continuous learning in areas such as:
- **Health and developmental psychology**
- **Psychometrics and latent variable modeling**
- **Applied statistical programming using R**
- **Evidence-based and data-driven research design**

## 📁 Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|:-------|:-------------|
| `01-` | Each numbered folder contains a separate research project. |
| `R/` | Modular R scripts organized by stage (data cleaning, analysis, reporting). |
| `reports/` | Automatically generated reports, tables, and visualizations. |
| `data/` | Cleaned, anonymized datasets with data dictionaries. |

This consistent structure supports both replicability and clarity, encouraging collaborative extensions and peer learning.

## 🌿 Research Focus

My current academic and research interests include:

- **Health Psychology:** identifying psychological and behavioral factors that shape mental well-being.  
- **Developmental Psychology:** understanding emotional regulation and behavioral outcomes in children.  
- **Quantitative Psychology & Data Science:** applying statistical modeling, R programming, and open science principles to improve research precision and transparency.  

These projects grow out of my background in clinical and developmental psychology, and my current effort to bridge that foundation with modern computational and data-driven approaches.

## 💬 A Note from the Researcher

I’m deeply motivated by the belief that good research should be **replicable, clear, and socially meaningful**.  
Each project in this repository represents both a scientific exploration and a step toward stronger, more transparent practices in psychology.  

I’m always open to **research collaboration**, **doctoral opportunities**, and **interdisciplinary discussions**—especially those that connect psychology, data science, and human well-being.

If any of the projects here resonate with your interests, I would be very glad to connect and exchange ideas.
