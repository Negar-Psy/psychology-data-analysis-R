# Psychology Data Analysis in R

**Reproducible statistical programming in psychology** — open R projects showcasing advanced statistical analysis, including structural equation modeling, psychometrics, and reproducible workflows with `targets`, `renv`, and Quarto.

## Projects

### [01-students-internet-addiction](01-students-internet-addiction)
Analysis of Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and SRQ-20 among Malawian college students.

## Repo Structure
- Each project lives in its own folder (`01-`, `02-`, …).  
- Each project has its own README with methods, files, and results.  
- Root README provides an overview and links to projects.
