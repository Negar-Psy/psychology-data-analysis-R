## About the Dataset  
- **Population:** 984 tertiary students in Malawi  
- **Period:** May–July 2018  
- **Design:** Cross-sectional, self-report survey  
- **Instruments:**  
  - **Internet Addiction Test (IAT)** — 20 Likert items (0–5 scale, 99 = missing)  
  - **Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20)** — 20 Yes/No items (0 = Yes, 1 = No, 7 = missing)  

---

## Derived Variables (in dataset)  
- **Internet_usg** — Total IAT score (sum of 20 IAT items). Range: 0–90 observed (theoretical max = 100).  
- **Internet_Add** — Categorical IAT severity derived from Internet_usg:  
  - 0 = <20 (none)  
  - 1 = 20–39 (mild)  
  - 2 = 40–69 (moderate)  
  - 3 = 70–100 (severe)  
- **SQR_Total** — Raw SRQ-20 total (0–20). Includes missing values.  
- **New_SQR_total** — Clean SRQ-20 total (0–20). No missing values.  
- **SQR_catg** — Categorized SRQ-20:  
  - 0 = No probable common mental disorder (CMD)  
  - 1 = Probable CMD (cutoff ≥ 8)  
- **filter__** — Convenience flag: 1 = probable CMD, 0 = otherwise.

## Ethics & Limitations  
- Cross-sectional, self-report survey (IAT, SRQ-20).  
- SRQ-20 ≥ 8 indicates *probable CMD* (screening only, not diagnosis).  
- Malawi-specific context; generalization to other populations should be cautious.
